Benchmarks were run on an Intel i3930K. Note that the 'ns/iter' value is 
computed by each language's microbenchmark facilities. I suspect the 
granularity is big enough that the values are comparable.

Note that short = 398KB, medium = 1.4MB and large = 5.9MB.

Rust  short    13313251 ns/iter (+/- 11342)
Go    short    13620130 ns/iter (100 iterations)
Rust  medium   44827980 ns/iter (+/- 39679)
Go    medium   45079987 ns/iter (50 iterations)
Rust  large   202532195 ns/iter (+/- 437456)
Go    large   202660744 ns/iter (10 iterations)

You'll note that none of the above benchmarks use a particularly large CSV 
file. So I've also run a pretty rough benchmark on a huge CSV (3.6GB). A single 
large benchmark isn't exactly definitive, but I think we can use it as a 
ballpark estimate.

The huge benchmark for both Rust and Go use buffering. The times are wall 
clock times.

Rust  huge    141 seconds
Go    huge    157 seconds
